        Parrots can be a variety of sizes depending on their species, however, a good rule of thumb to follow is that their cage should be at least double the size of their full wingspan, although the bigger, the better. Parrots do not always share their space well with others, even those of their own kind, so be careful if you plan to mix your birds, watching closely for signs of aggression.
